#  JavaScript prototype-based inheritance visualized

JsInheritance is an Javascript Object Oriented Programming visualizer aimed to learn the basic concepts of POO in JS.

This repository is a fork of the original jsinheritance repository so that I could add Spanish and French translation to it.

The original project can be found (here)[https://github.com/rus0000/jsinheritance]
